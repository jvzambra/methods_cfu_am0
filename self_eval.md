# Self-Evaluation

1. Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud of how the pairing activitys have gone earlier. On the down side, I'm needing quite a bit of practice to best retain all this information.
2. What is the power of using methods in our applications?
-  Methods are powerful due to their reusability and help to simplify what would otherwise be longer lines of code.
